# GaduGadu_profile_picture-downloader
simple python script to automatically download profile pictures of gg numbers written down in a file (you can easly create script to generate file like this, good with automatical roulette bot).
# how to use this
- change paths (this should work on windows as well as on linux, just change the paths)
- create "profilowe" directory
- create "GG_names" file with GG numbers (i recommend doing it automatically with automatic roulette bot via burpsuite and reshaper)
- create "counter" file with number "0" in it
